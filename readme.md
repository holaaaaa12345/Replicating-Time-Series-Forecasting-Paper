#### Potential Bug Issue
1) Okay, there is a fatal mistake in my modeling, hence the result is most certainly inaccurate. Soon to be fixed.
2) I notice that there is a different in the best model written in the output and the ones that i explained in the markdown cells. Somehow, the current code outputs different best model compared to the first code (when i wrote the explanation). Since I write the codes and description using two devices with different dependencies, I suspect that this is caused by certain bug or compatibility issue. Soon to be fixed.
